# Convex-Hull
Convex Hull Project - y2022 - in collaboration with J. Racki and M.Morales  

For this project, we had to work on an imposed subject, ours being the convex hulls.
  
According to the subject, we had to realise a program doing the convex hull of a scatter graph generated randomly, using 3 different methods.  
  
With this program, you will be able to play with many parameters to draw different Convex hulls.  
Note : When you have run the program, you will have a list of the commands available by putting your mouse on the keyboard logo in the top left corner of the window.  
  
You will also find in this repository our project report, explaining in details how each method works. (only available in French)
  
To use this program :  
  
Be sure you have an IDE that can run .py files in the first place (Spyder for exmaple)  
Then, download the folder Convex_Hull_EN if you want the English version of the program, or Convex_Hull_FR if you want the French one  
Finally, in both cases, after unzipping the folder you just downloaded, open the "Projet_2_Morales_Marques_Racki.py" file in your IDE, and run the program !
